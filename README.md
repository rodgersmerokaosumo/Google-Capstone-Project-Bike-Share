**Introduction** 

Welcome to  the  Cyclistic  bike-share  analysis  case  study!  In  this  case  study,  you  will perform  many  real-world  tasks  of a junior data  analyst.  You will work  for  a  fictional  company,  Cyclistic,  and  meet  different  characters and  team  members.  In  order  to answer the  key  business questions,  you  will follow  the  steps  of  the  data  analysis process:  **ask** , **prepare** , **process** , **analyze** , **share** , and  **act** . Along the  way,  the  **Case**  **Study**  **Roadmap**  tables  — including guiding questions and  key  tasks  — will help  you stay  on  the  right  path. 

By the  end  of  this  lesson, you  will  have  a  portfolio-ready case  study. Download the  packet  and  reference  the details  of  this case study  anytime.   Then,  when   you begin  your job hunt, your  case study  will   be a tangible    way  to demonstrate  your knowledge   and  skills to  potential employers. 

**Scenario** 

You are  a  junior  data  analyst  working  in the  marketin g analyst  team  at Cyclistic, a bike-share  compan y in Chicago . The directo r of  marketin g believes  the  company’s  future  success  depend s on  maximizin g the  number  of annual  membership s. Therefore, your  team  wants  to  understan d how  casual  riders  and  annual  members  use  Cyclistic  bikes  differently . From  these  insights, your  team  will design  a new  marketin g strateg y to convert  casual  riders  into  annual  members.  But first,  Cyclistic executives must  approve  your  recommendation s, so  they  must  be  backed  up  with  compellin g data  insights  and  profession al data 

visualization s.

**Characters**  **and**  **team** **s**

- **Cyclistic:**  A bike-share  program  that  features  more  than  5,800  bicycles  and  600  docking  stations.  Cyclistic sets  itself apart  by  also  offering  reclining  bikes,  hand  tricycles,  and  cargo  bikes,  making  bike-share  more  inclusive  to people  with disabilities  and  riders  who  can’t  use  a standard  two-wheeled  bike.  The majority  of riders  opt  for traditional  bikes;  abou t 8% of  riders  use  the  assistive  options.  Cyclistic users  are  more  likely to ride  for leisure,  but  abou t 30% use  them  to commute  to  work  each  day. 
- **Lily Moreno:**  The  director  of  marketin g and  your  manager.  Moreno  is responsib le for the  developmen t of  campaign s and  initiatives  to  promote  the  bike-share  program . These  may  include  email,  social  media,  and  other  channels. 
- **Cyclistic**  **marketing**  **analytics**  **team** **:** A team  of data  analysts  who  are  responsib le for collecting , analyzing , and reportin g data  that  helps  guide  Cyclistic marketin g strategy.  You joined  this  team  six month s ago  and  have  been  busy learning  abou t Cyclistic’s mission  and  business  goals  — as  well as how  you,  as a junior  data  analyst,  can  help  Cyclistic achieve  them .
- **Cyclistic**  **executiv** **e team** **:** The  notoriously  detail-oriented  executive  team  will decide  whether  to approve  the recommend ed marketin g program .

**About**  **the**  **company** 

In 2016 , Cyclistic  launched  a successfu l bike-share  offering . Since  then , the  program  has  grown  to a fleet  of 5,824  bicycles  that are  geotracked  and  locked  into  a network  of 692  station s across  Chicago.  The bikes  can  be  unlocked  from  one  station  and returned  to  any  other  station  in the  system  anytime. 

Until  now , Cyclistic’s marketin g strateg y relied  on  building  general  awareness  and  appealin g to broad  consumer  segments. One  approach  that  helped  make  these  things  possible  was  the  flexibility  of its pricing  plans:  single-rid e passes,  full-day  passes, and  annual  membership s. Customers  who  purchase  single-rid e or  full-day  passes  are  referred  to as casual  riders.  Customers who  purchase  annual  membership s are  Cyclistic  members. 

Cyclistic’s finance  analysts  have  concluded  that  annual  members  are  much  more  profitable  than  casual  riders.  Although  the pricing  flexibility  helps  Cyclistic attract  more  customers,  Moreno  believes  that  maximizin g the  number  of annual  members  will be  key  to  future  growth . Rather  than  creatin g a marketin g campaig n that  targets  all-new  customers,  Moreno  believes  there  is a very  good  chance  to  convert  casual  riders  into  members.  She  notes  that  casual  riders  are  alread y aware  of the  Cyclistic 

program  and  have  chosen  Cyclistic for their  mobility  needs. 

Moreno  has  set  a clear  goal:  Design  marketin g strategies  aimed  at  convertin g casual  riders  into  annual  members.  In order  to do  that,  however,  the  marketin g analyst  team  need s to better  understan d how  annual  members  and  casual  riders  differ,  why casual  riders  would  buy  a membership , and  how  digital  media  could  affect  their  marketin g tactics.  Moreno  and  her  team  are interested  in analyzing  the  Cyclistic historical  bike  trip  data  to identify  trends. 

**Ask** 

Three  question s will guide  the  future  marketin g program :

1. How  do  annual  members  and  casual  riders  use  Cyclistic bikes  differently ?
1. Why  would  casual  riders  buy  Cyclistic annual  membership s?
1. How  can  Cyclistic  use  digital  media  to  influence  casual  riders  to becom e members? 

Moreno  has  assigned  you  the  first  questio n to  answer:  How  do  annual  members  and  casual  riders  use  Cyclistic bikes 

differently ?

You will produce  a report  with  the  following  deliverables: 

1. A clear  statemen t of the  business  task 
1. A description  of  all data  sources  used 
1. Documentation  of  any  cleaning  or  manipulatio n of  data 
1. A summary  of your  analysis 
1. Supportin g visualization s and  key finding s
1. Your  top  three  recommendation s based  on  your  analysis 

Use  the  following  Case  Study  Roadmap  as  a guide.  Note:  Completin g this  case  study  within  a week  is a good  goal.
